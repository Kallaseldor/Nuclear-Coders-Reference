Diamonds to Square transformation

Given a set of diamonds with radius R on the plane,
you are to process connectivity queries between
those diamonds.

The set {(a, b): |a - x| + |b - y| <= R} forms a
diamond with center (x, y). By rotating it by 45
degrees, we can turn it into a square. The transform

X' = X + Y
Y' = X - Y

makes such rotation with additional stretching.
Squares with centers (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) wil overlap
iff max (|X1 - X2|, |Y1 - Y2|) <= 2R.

Dist ((X1', Y1'), (X2', Y2')) = max (delta X', delta Y')

To calculate the intersection of many diamonds we can
fix point (X2, Y2) and find the maximum and minimum
values of X1 + Y1 and X1 - Y1 (which are independant
of (X2, Y2)) and try all possible points (X2, Y2).
