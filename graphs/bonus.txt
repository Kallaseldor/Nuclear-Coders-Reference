Minimum Path Cover:

Given a directed graph, find the minimum number of
disjointed paths needed to cover the whole graph

Solution:
Clone the graph's vertices and separate them into
left and right and add edge LU -> RV ifft he edge
U -> V is present on the original graph. The answer
to the problem is ( |V| - Max Matching )

Complexity:
Using Kuhn's algorithm		O( |V| * |E| )
Using Dinic's algorithm		O( sqrt(|V|) * |E| )
